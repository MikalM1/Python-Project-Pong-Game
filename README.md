# Python-Project-Pong-Game

This Python code creates a game of Pong that allows the user to play with an AI generated player. It uses the module turtle to create the screen and objects of the 
game (the paddles, the ball, and the scoreboard). The user can move his/her paddle by pressing the up and down keys.
